## Introduction
The backend of our application is responsible for handling the server-side logic and data management. It provides the necessary APIs for the frontend to interact with the database and perform various operations.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Web Framework: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- Database: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Getting Started
To set up the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up the database: `python manage.py migrate`
4. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`

## API Endpoints
The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `/api/users`: Endpoint for managing user accounts.
- `/api/posts`: Endpoint for managing posts.
- `/api/comments`: Endpoint for managing comments.

For detailed information about each endpoint and the supported operations, refer to the [API documentation](api-documentation.md).

## Authentication
The backend uses token-based authentication. To authenticate requests to protected endpoints, include the `Authorization` header with the value `Token <token>`.

## Database Schema
The backend uses a PostgreSQL database with the following schema:
For a detailed description of the database schema, refer to the [Database Schema documentation](database-schema.md).

## Deployment
The backend can be deployed to a production environment using a platform like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/). Refer to the platform's documentation for detailed deployment instructions.

## Contributing
Contributions to the backend are welcome! To contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Add your commit message"`
4. Push the changes to your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
5. Open a pull request
